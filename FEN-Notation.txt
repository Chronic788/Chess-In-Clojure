FEN Notation
------------
FEN notation is a standard notation to describe a board position of a chess game.


The FEN starting position:

rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1

The FEN String contains 6 fields with a space as a separator:

1. Piece placement from White's perspective.

   Ranks are described between the / characters with 8 being leftmost and decending to 1

   White pieces are UPPER CASE
   Black pieces are LOWER CASE
   Empty squares are denoted numerically 1 to 8
   / separates ranks
   
2. Active color:

   w = White
   b = Black

3. Castling availability

   - = neither side can castle
   K = White can castle Kingside
   W = White can castle Queenside
   k = Black can castle Kingside
   q = Black can castle Queenside

4. En passant target square in algebraic notation

   - = no target square
   
   If a pawn has just made a two square move, this is the square behind the Pawn
   This is always recorded

5. Halfmove clock : The number of halfmoves since the last capture

   Used to determine a draw under the fifty move rule

6. Full move number. The number of full moves made so far:

   Incremented after Black's move
